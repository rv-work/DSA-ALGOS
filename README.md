## ðŸ“– How to Use This Guide

1. **Topic-wise Practice**: Focus on one topic at a time and solve multiple problems from that category
2. **Algorithm Understanding**: Study the algorithm first, then implement it from scratch
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Many problems follow similar patterns - learn to identify them
4. **Time Complexity**: Always analyze and optimize your solutions
5. **Edge Cases**: Test your solutions with various edge cases

## ðŸŽ¯ Study Tips

- Start with easier problems and gradually move to harder ones
- Implement algorithms from scratch before looking at solutions
- Practice explaining your approach - this helps in interviews
- Time yourself to improve problem-solving speed
- Review and revise previously solved problems regularly
